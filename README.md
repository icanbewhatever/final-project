<br>
▪️ Additional Features: Implemented Ajax for asynchronous web page updates and integrated openAPI for enhanced functionality and data exchange.
<br>
Development Process:
<br>
▪️ Utilized IntelliJ IDEA and STS4 (Eclipse) for coding and development.
<br>
▪️ Used Git and GitHub for version control, ensuring smooth collaboration and integration among team members.
<br>
▪️ Employed Figma for UI/UX design, creating intuitive and visually appealing interfaces.
